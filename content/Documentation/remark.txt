# The program has prepared following useful information that you can use now:
# %field - fully parsed and decoded form input data.
# %cookie - parsed cookies.
#
# Also, you can place your own variables into the 'xgear.conf' file in order to
# prevent troubles with the variable naming. All system and user-defined
# variables are accessible in the %config hash.
#
# User-defined modules can be placed either here as a subroutines, or inside
# special directory. (It is predefined in the "modules_dir" line of the "xgear.conf")
# In case of using external files, filename will be used to identify your module.
